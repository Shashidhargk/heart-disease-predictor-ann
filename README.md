**Abstract
**
Deep neural networks are powerful and popular algorithms in this era. Understanding the architecture and how neural networks learn remains one of the central challenges in deep learning research. A lot of their success lies in the careful design of the neural network architecture. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are essential tools in deep learning that are increasingly used for building computational models in neuroscience.

In this study, a Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) is developed using an ANN algorithm to predict the risk level of heart disease. The system uses 13 medical parameters—such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity—for prediction. The HDPS predicts the likelihood of patients developing heart disease. The obtained results illustrate that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart disease. The README also details how to customize the analysis, structure, and learning of ANNs to better address various challenges in AI. Tutorial-style code is provided in TensorFlow, compatible with PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook for hands-on experience. 


**Problem Statement
**Heart disease can be effectively managed with a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and—in some cases—surgery. Early detection of cardiac diseases can significantly reduce mortality and complications, as well as lower costs associated with surgical treatments. While tools exist to predict heart disease, many are either expensive or inefficient. Moreover, continuous patient monitoring by a doctor isn't always feasible due to time and expertise constraints. Given the abundance of available data today, machine learning or deep learning algorithms can be leveraged to uncover hidden patterns to assist in health diagnosis
